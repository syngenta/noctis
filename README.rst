What is **NOCTIS**?
---------------

**NOCTIS** is a Python package for modeling and analyzing chemical reaction data as graph structures.

It allows you to build and explore complex reaction networks ‚Äî beyond just molecules and chemical equations ‚Äî by supporting additional node types, metadata, and relationships.

**NOCTIS** provides tools to:

- Preprocess and validate chemical reaction datasets
- Build graph representations from reaction data
- Query and navigate reaction networks
- Mine synthesis routes using a custom `Java plugin <https://github.com/syngenta/noctis-route-miner>`_
- Interact programmatically with graph databases
- Transform query results into formats suitable for further analysis (e.g., NetworkX, Pandas)



To learn more, visit the `documentation <https://noctis.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Try it interactively with our example notebook!
üìì `Example Notebook <https://github.com/syngenta/noctis/tree/main/jupyters>`_

Installation
------------

Create a dedicated Python environment for this package with your favorite environment manager.

.. code-block:: shell

   conda create -n noctis python=3.9
   conda activate noctis

* Option 1: Install the package from the GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/syngenta/noctis.git@main

* Option 2: Install the package from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install noctis

Configuration
-------------

Both **NOCTIS** and its companion package **Linchemin** need a small on-disk configuration before you can use them.

After installation, and before the first usage, run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    noctis_configure && linchemin_configure

What each command does
----------------------

| ``noctis_configure``
| Creates the directory ``~/noctis/`` and writes three files

    |  ``settings.yaml`` ‚Äì default runtime settings (edit as needed)
    |  ``.secrets.yaml`` ‚Äì placeholders for credentials (replace with the real
      values)
    |  ``schema.yaml`` ‚Äì description of the graph schema used by the database

| ``linchemin_configure``
| Creates the directory ``~/linchemin/`` and writes two files

    |  ``settings.toml`` ‚Äì default settings you may tweak
    |  ``.secrets.toml`` ‚Äì placeholders for the required secrets

For more details:

| üîß **NOCTIS** ‚Äì see the *Configuration* chapter of this `documentation <https://noctis.readthedocs.io/>`_.
| üîß **Linchemin** ‚Äì see the `Linchemin repo <https://github.com/syngenta/linchemin>`_ for full details.
|
|
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **ALERT** ‚ö†Ô∏è:
| If you skip this step you‚Äôll run straight into mysterious import errors (e.g. *‚ÄúSettings object has no attribute ‚ÄòCONSTRUCTORS‚Äô‚Äù*). The fix is simply to run the two commands above once.


Development Installation
---------------------------

If you're working on the development of **NOCTIS** and want to run directly from source:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone git@gitlab.com:syngentagroup/scientific-computing-team/noctis.git
   pip install -e noctis/[dev]
