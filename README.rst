What is Noctis?
---------------

**NOCTIS** is a Python package for modeling and analyzing chemical reaction data as graph structures.

It allows you to build and explore complex reaction networks â€” beyond just molecules and chemical equations â€” by supporting additional node types, metadata, and relationships.

**NOCTIS** provides tools to:

- Preprocess and validate chemical reaction datasets
- Build graph representations from reaction data
- Query and navigate reaction networks
- Mine synthesis routes using a custom `Java plugin <https://github.com/syngenta/noctis-route-miner>`_
- Interact programmatically with graph databases
- Transform query results into formats suitable for further analysis (e.g., NetworkX, Pandas)



To learn more, visit the `documentation <https://noctis.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Try it interactively with our example notebook!

Installation
------------

Create a dedicated Python environment for this package with your favorite environment manager.

.. code-block:: shell

   conda create -n noctis python=3.9
   conda activate noctis

* Option 1: Install the package from the GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/syngenta/noctis.git@main

* Option 2: Install the package from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install noctis

Configuration
-------------

This package requires some configuration parameters to work,
including some secrets to store access credentials to database and services.

After installation, and before the first usage, run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    noctis_configure

This command creates a `<home>/noctis` directory and places into it:

1. `settings.yaml` â€“ populated with default settings. You can review and modify them.
2. `.secrets.yaml` â€“ contains placeholders for secrets. Fill them with your actual values.
3. `schema.yaml` â€“ a description of the graph schema used in the database.

ðŸ”§ For more details, refer to the **Configuration** section of the documentation.

Development Installation
---------------------------

If you're working on the development of Noctis and want to run directly from source:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone git@gitlab.com:syngentagroup/scientific-computing-team/noctis.git
   pip install -e noctis/[dev]
